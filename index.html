                    Since 1939, the number of countries considering, pursuing, and stockpiling 
                    <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> has dramatically changed. At the height of the
                    <a class="blue">Cold War</a>, almost 20 nations fell under these three categories for
                    <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> proliferation. In 2022, there are only 9 sovereign states with <a class="red">nuclear weapon</a> capabilities: 
                    United States, Russia, United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea. 
                    There is a common misconception that many other countries pursued <a class="red">nuclear weapon</a> capability since the Second World War. 
                    </br></br>However, the map above demonstrates that only a few countries have ever possessed (stockpiled)
                    <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a>, and only a few pursue and have considered <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a>
                    over time. In regard to proliferation, the chart to the right shows that nations considering, pursuing, or possessing
                    <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> peaked during the <a class="blue">Cold War</a> around 1980. 
                    The number of nations has since reduced where only Syria considers them, and Iran pursues them along with the 9 countries that stockpile
                    <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a>.

              The adjacent chart shows the number of <a class="red">nuclear weapon</a> tests that 
              have taken place since 1945. As noted above, we can see that the 
              <a class="blue">Cold War</a>, was the most active period where almost 180  <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> tests took place in 1962 alone. 
              </br></br>
              The increased number of tests during the <a class="blue">Cold War</a> can be attributed to the 
              <a class="brown">Arms Race</a> where the United States and Russia were competing to increase the sizer and quality of 
              their military resources to gain superiority over one another.
              <br><br> The world's first nuclear bomb test codenamed 
              <a class="teal">Trinity</a> took place on July 16, 1945. An image of the test is shown below. However,
              <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> were only used in warfare during the Second World War, when American bombers 
              deployed the atomic bomb over the Japanese cities of
              <a class="teal">Hiroshima</a> and <a class="teal">Nagasaki</a> in an effort to bring about Japan's surrender to end the war (images below). 
              </br></br>Since the Japanese bombings, there has been no use of atomic bombs in warfare. 
              Despite this, the world nuclear powerhouses have amassed over 2000 <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> tests to date.

                A way to quantify the proliferation of <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> 
                over time is to look at the stockpiles and inventories of countries over time. 
                The estimated inventories of countries are larger than the nuclear warhead stockpiles as 
                they do not include retired warheads queued for dismantlement. 
                <br><br>
                The chart to the right illustrates the estimated number of warheads in a countries military stockpile over time. 
                As we can see the number of warheads has reduced significantly since the peak of military 
                stockpiles in 1986, mitigating the risk and potential arsenal of nuclear powerhouse nations over time. 
                <br><br>
                The reduction in <a class="red">nuclear weapon</a> stockpiles can be attributed to the
                end of the <a class="blue">Cold War</a> combined with the global reduction in nuclear missile spending.
                Furthermore, safeguards and treaties have been established to ban nuclear warfare. This aims to avoid any future misconduct
                and deter countries from engaging in nuclear combat to prevent the world from suffering catastrophic damage.

                Despite this progress, the nine world nuclear powers still possess around 12,700 
                warheads as of 2022 with 90% of warheads owned by the United States and Russia. 
                Due to the retiring of warheads, global inventories have been decreasing over the 
                past 30 years. However, it is believed that China, India, North Korea, Pakistan and 
                the United Kingdom, and possibly Russia, are suspected to still be increasing their

              Despite the slow decline of  <a class="red">nuclear weapon</a> 
              proliferation, bomb testing and arsenal size over the last 30 years,
              <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> still remain necessary for global nuclear powers.
              As opposed to discussing nuclear disarmament, global nuclear powers have planned to retain 
              or even increase their arsenals in the near future. This can be attributed to the disagreement 
              regarding nuclear non-proliferation treaties and strategies. With the current political climate, 
              the use of <a class="red">nuclear weapons</a> are not looking to slow down, but rather act 
              as a deterrent for other nations to remain out of conflict. This is done with the goal to 
              maintain the maximum possible level of global peace in mind today.
